        "designSummary": "**The Controlled Developer Playground: A Fusion of Tech Minimalism and Interactive Exploration**\n\nThe Vision: This website is not a static portfolio, but a dynamic environment showcasing engineering discipline and growth potential. It balances a calm, reliable core with carefully chosen experimental zones, reflecting a controlled developer playground. The design prioritizes interaction and clear communication over flashy aesthetics.\n\n**Execution Blueprint:**\n1. Dark Mode Foundation: A deep neutral background (#121212) with off-white text (#E0E0E0) establishes a quiet confidence. One accent color (e.g., #007BFF) is used sparingly to highlight key interactive elements.\n2. Apple-Inspired Motion Discipline: GSAP is used for precise control over animations. Easing curves and interaction quality are inspired by Apple's design language, focusing on communicating state and intent.\n3. Hybrid Structure: A scroll-based home page provides an overview, linking to a separate, interactive projects page. The contact section is intentionally simple and reliable.\n4. Projects as Interactive Explorations: Projects are presented one at a time, using progressive reveals, expand-on-interaction behavior, or scroll-based exploration. Hover/click interactions reveal stack, architecture, or design decisions.\n5. Anti-Generic Constraints: Avoid motivational filler text, fake metrics, loud gradients, template-like layouts, and resume dumps. The site is interaction-driven, with clear state changes on scroll, hover, or click.",

'MutedOlive' is best used as a subtle background accent behind images or sections to add natural warmth without overpowering. 'DarkText' is reserved for body text and navigation to ensure crisp readability on light backgrounds. 'SubtleBorder' can be applied to delineate sections or UI boundaries gently without harsh contrast.

The 'secondaryForeground' on 'secondary' background also meets WCAG AA standards for buttons and interactive elements. 'DarkText' on 'background' provides excellent contrast for body text, surpassing WCAG AAA requirements. 'MutedOlive' used as a background accent maintains sufficient contrast with 'primaryForeground' text when applied carefully.

It balances a calm, reliable core with carefully chosen experimental zones, reflecting a controlled developer playground. The design prioritizes interaction and clear communication over flashy aesthetics.\n\n**Execution Blueprint:**\n1. Dark Mode Foundation: A deep neutral background (#121212) with off-white text (#E0E0E0) establishes a quiet confidence. One accent color (e.g., #007BFF) is used sparingly to highlight key interactive elements.\n2. Apple-Inspired Motion Discipline: GSAP is used for precise control over animations. Easing curves and interaction quality are inspired by Apple's design language, focusing on communicating state and intent.\n3. Hybrid Structure: A scroll-based home page provides an overview, linking to a separate, interactive projects page. The contact section is intentionally simple and reliable.\n4. Projects as Interactive Explorations: Projects are presented one at a time, using progressive reveals, expand-on-interaction behavior, or scroll-based exploration. Hover/click interactions reveal stack, architecture, or design decisions.\n5. Anti-Generic Constraints: Avoid motivational filler text, fake metrics, loud gradients, template-like layouts, and resume dumps. The site is interaction-driven, with clear state changes on scroll, hover, or click.",

The site must communicate engineering discipline, attention to detail, and strong growth potential, even though there are no large production deployments yet.\n\nThe website should feel like a controlled developer playground. Experimental in a few intentional places, calm and reliable everywhere else.\nThis is not a generic portfolio, not a marketing landing page, and not a static resume website.\n\nThe intended recruiter takeaway is:\n“No big production wins yet, but this person clearly thinks like an engineer and has strong upside.”\n\nVisual direction:\nUse a dark theme by default with a deep neutral background, off-white text, and a maximum of one accent color. Avoid pure black and pure white.\nThe aesthetic should feel quietly confident, minimal, and precise.\nApple inspiration should be reflected in motion discipline, spacing, easing curves, and interaction quality, not visual cloning or glassmorphism overload.\n\nAnimation and interactivity:\nUse GSAP or an equivalent animation system with strict control.\nAnimations must communicate state, hierarchy, or intent.\nNo infinite loops.\nNo animation longer than roughly 800ms.\nScroll animations should trigger once.\nRespect reduced-motion preferences and provide graceful fallbacks for low-end devices.\n\nExplicitly avoid generic fade-up animations on every section, decorative motion with no purpose, identical transitions across sections, and animation overload.\n\nExperimental but controlled rule:\nOnly one strong experimental interaction is allowed in the hero section.\nThe projects section is the primary experimental zone.\nAbout, qualifications, and experience sections should be calm and minimal.\nThe contact section must be boring, reliable, and free of gimmicks.\n\nStructure:\nUse a hybrid structure.\nA primary home page with a scroll-based overview including hero, short about, qualifications or experience, and an entry point into projects.\nA separate projects page for deep interactive exploration.\nAn optional resume or meta page with a downloadable PDF resume.\nAvoid unnecessary pages such as standalone skills or certifications unless they add real value.\n\nProjects section requirements:\nShow one website project and one mobile app project hosted on GitHub.\nProvide a proper place for screenshots, a GitHub link, and a live link if available.\n\nDo not use static image grids or generic project cards.\nInstead, present one project in focus at a time.\nUse progressive screenshot reveals, expand-on-interaction behavior, or scroll-based exploration.\nAllow hover or click interactions to reveal stack, architecture, or design decisions.\nProjects should feel alive and explorable, not archived.\n\nAnti-generic constraints:\nDo not include motivational filler text, “passionate developer” language, fake metrics, loud gradients, template-like layouts, or resume dumps.\nDo not rely on purely decorative animations or static layouts.\n\nThe site must be interaction-driven, with clear state changes on scroll, hover, or click.\n\nContent tone:\nCalm, confident, precise, and engineer-minded.\nNo hype language. No fluff. No exaggeration.\n\nContact form:\nInclude fields for name (required), email (required), subject (optional), and message (required).\nProvide auto-suggest subject chips such as Hiring, Collaboration, or Feedback.\nUse subtle validation, clear success feedback, and no fake loading animations.\n\nSEO and performance:\nUse server-side rendering.\nEnsure semantic HTML, clean metadata, and readable content without JavaScript.\nOptimize for fast load times and do not block content with animations.\nUse skeleton loaders only for asynchronous or dynamic content such as projects or images.\n\nFinal quality bar:\nThe website should feel like a well-engineered product rather than a flashy portfolio or animation demo.\nIf it feels like a template, a PDF on the web, or a design showcase with no depth, the output has failed.",
